On the other hand, we denounce with righteous 
indignation and dislike men who are so beguiled 
and demoralized by the charms of pleasure of the moment, 
so blinded by desire, that they cannot foresee the pain and trouble 
that are bound to ensue; and equal blame belongs to those who fail in their duty 
through weakness of will, which is the same as saying through shrinking from toil and pain.
These cases are perfectly simple and easy to distinguish. In a free hour, when our power of choice is 
untrammelled and when nothing prevents our being able to do what we like best, every pleasure is to be welcomed 
and every pain avoided. But in certain circumstances and owing to the claims of duty or the
obligations of business it will frequently occur that pleasures have to be repudiated and annoyances 
accepted. The wise man therefore always holds in these matters to this principle of selection: he rejects 
pleasures to secure other greater pleasures, or else he endures pains to avoid worse pains.
